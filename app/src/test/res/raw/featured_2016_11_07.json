  "extract": "\"From The Doctor to my son Thomas\" is a viral video recorded by actor Peter Capaldi and sent to autistic nine-year-old Thomas Goodall to console the child over grief from the death of Goodall's grandmother. Capaldi filmed the video in character as the 12th incarnation of the Doctor in the BBC science-fiction series Doctor Who. Capaldi's message had a positive effect on Thomas; his father said the boy smiled for the first time since learning of his grandmother's death and gained the courage to go to her funeral.\nThomas' father Ross Goodall posted the video to YouTube on 6 November 2014. He later explained to media that he wanted to make the video available to his family and had no idea it would become popular online.",
