# README

Since April 29th, 2017, Wikipedia (with all of the languages and their content) has been blocked in Turkey. And as of today, June 14th 2018, the block continues. This app is a forked from of official Wikipedia App (firstly version 2.6.206 and then 2.7.225) and it uses vikiansiklopedi.org(which is a mirror proxy of wikipedia.org) instead of wikipedia.org. This mirror proxy is chosen among others because its legidity and support for more than two languages(thanks to owner of this proxy C.Cantaro). Note that editing content does not work since Wikipedia does not support editing using proxies. 


I first released this app on the December 4th, and maintained and pushed few updates since then because of the ongoing block. I hope this app will be pointless to use soon.


This app and vikiansiklopedi.org is not affiliated to Wikimedia Foundation.
